# skill-mycroft-radio

Initial version which needs some clean up. 

Currently the vocab and dialog trees are copied from the npr news skill
so these will need to be cleaned up, but for now the skill should play
music which was the goal. 

Uses a free user contributed radio station index (see code for endpoint)
to stream radio channels using standard audio service.
